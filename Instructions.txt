You will most likely need to at least install
the imager package
#install.packages('imager', dependencies = TRUE)
and possibly the rlang package
#install.packages('rlang')
then, use the libraries of each
#library(rlang)
#library(imager)
source the hangman.R file in another R file
#source("hangman.R")
and call the hangman function with a csv file imported as a variable
#hangman(csvVariable)


Make sure you have the images in your working directory.
